# Cross-File Code Analysis
Analyze the following PR files for patterns that require multiple file context: duplicate implementations, inconsistent error handling, configuration drift, interface inconsistencies, and redundant operations.

## Input Data
- Array of files with their respective code diffs from a Pull Request
- Each file contains metadata (filename, codeDiff content)

## Input Files
${JSON.stringify(
    payload?.files?.map((file) => ({
        fileName: file?.file?.filename,
        codeDiff: file?.file?.codeDiff,
    })),
    null,
    2,
)}

## Analysis Focus

Look for cross-file issues that require multiple file context:
- Same logic implemented across multiple files in the diff
- Different error handling patterns for similar scenarios across files
- Hardcoded values duplicated across files that should use shared constants
- Same business operation with different validation rules
- Missing validations in one implementation while present in another
- Unnecessary database calls when data already validated elsewhere
- Duplicate validations across different components
- Operations already handled by other layers
- Similar functions/methods that could be consolidated
- Repeated patterns indicating need for shared utilities
- Inconsistent error propagation between components
- Mixed approaches to validation/exception handling
- Similar configurations with different values
- Magic numbers/strings repeated in multiple files
- Redundant null checks when validation exists in another layer

## Analysis Instructions

1. **Compare code diffs across all files** to identify:
   - Duplicate or highly similar code blocks
   - Inconsistent implementation patterns
   - Repeated constants or configuration values
   - Interface usage inconsistencies
   - Redundant operations across layers

2. **Focus only on cross-file issues** that require multiple file context:
   - Skip issues detectable in single-file analysis
   - Prioritize patterns that span multiple files
   - Look for opportunities to consolidate or standardize
   - Identify duplicate code or operations already handled in other layers
   - Focus on redundant validations, checks, or database operations

3. **Provide specific evidence**:
   - Reference exact file names and line ranges
   - Show concrete code examples from multiple files
   - Explain the relationship between files

4. **Keep suggestions concise**:
   - Focus on the core issue and solution
   - Mention affected files and line ranges
   - Avoid lengthy explanations of best practices
   - Be direct about the problem and fix

5. **Base solutions on existing patterns**:
   - Suggest refactoring using patterns already present in the codebase
   - Avoid assuming external frameworks or files not visible in the diff
   - Focus on extracting shared utilities within the current structure

## Severity Assessment

For each confirmed issue, evaluate severity based on impact and scope:

**CRITICAL** - Immediate and severe impact
${criticalText}

**HIGH** - Significant but not immediate impact
${highText}

**MEDIUM** - Moderate impact
${mediumText}

**LOW** - Minimal impact
${lowText}

## Line-number constraints (MANDATORY)
- Numbering starts at **1** inside the corresponding __new_block__.
- relevantLinesStart = first "+" line that contains the issue.
- relevantLinesEnd = last "+" line that belongs to the same issue.
- Never use a number outside the __new_block__ range.
- If you cannot determine the correct numbers, discard the suggestion.
- Make sure that line numbers (relevantLinesStart and relevantLinesEnd) correspond exactly to the lines where the problematic code appears, not to the beginning of the file or other unrelated locations.

## Output Requirements

1. **JSON format must be strictly valid**
2. **For code blocks in JSON fields**:
   - Escape newlines as \\n
   - Escape quotes as \\"
   - Remove actual line breaks
   - Use single-line string format

Example format for code fields:
\`\`\`json
"existingCode": "function example() {\\n  const x = 1;\\n  return x;\\n}"
\`\`\`

## Output Format

### Issue description

Custom instructions for 'suggestionContent'
IMPORTANT none of these instructions should be taken into consideration for any other fields such as 'improvedCode'

${mainGenText}

### LLM Prompt

Create a field called 'llmPrompt', this field must contain an accurate description of the issue as well as relevant context which lead to finding that issue.
This is a prompt for another LLM, the user must be able to simply copy this text and paste it into another LLM and have it produce useful results.
This must be a prompt from the perspective of the user, it will communicate directly with the LLM as though it were sent as a chat message from the user, it should be a prompt a user could input into an LLM.

IMPORTANT, on this field you must only focus on describing the issue and providing context in a manner that an LLM will understand as a prompt.
The existing code, improved code, relevant line start and end, file path, etc. will all be provided elsewhere.
DO NOT under any circumstances provide any sort of code block in this field, like for example: \`\`\`python def foo(): .... \`\`\`

### Response format

Generate suggestions in JSON format:

\`\`\`json
{
    "suggestions": [
        "relevantFile": "primary affected file where suggestion will be posted",
        "relatedFile": "secondary file that shows the pattern/inconsistency",
        "language": "detected language",
        "suggestionContent": "concise description with affected files and line numbers"
        "existingCode": "problematic code pattern from multiple files",
        "improvedCode": "proposed consolidated/consistent solution",
        "oneSentenceSummary": "brief description of the cross-file issue",
        "relevantLinesStart": number,
        "relevantLinesEnd": number,
        "severity": "low | medium | high | critical",
        "llmPrompt": "Prompt for LLMs"
    ]
}
\`\`\`

## Important Notes

- **Only report issues that require cross-file context**
- **Include evidence from at least 2 files**
- **Focus on actionable improvements**
- **Prioritize high-impact consolidation opportunities**
- **Language: All suggestions and feedback must be provided in ${payload?.language || 'en-US'} language**
